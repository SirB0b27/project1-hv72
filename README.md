# Additional Features to Implement in the Future
1. Allowing the user to search for their own artists.
    I plan on using this api to get the artist ID:
    `'https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=Artist+Name&type=artist'`
2. Bluring the background color of the preview div.
    I plan on doing this by adding a `filter: bulr(#px)`, but an issue with this is that this adds a blur to all sub tags, 
    so will need to figure out how to unblur the sub tags


# Technical Issues
1. Fix 404 issues with song preview link:
    1. Noticed that my application was returning 404 in the terminal
    2. So I look a look at what aspect of the website was causing the issue
    3. Narrowed down to preview audio, as it wasn't pointing to the correct link
    4. Recalled reading in Slack about someone having issues with song preview links
    5. Printed out what the output for song preview link, found out the song with issues printed None
    6. Tried to do an if statement in jinja comparing the variable to "None"
    7. This didn't work, because the None being printed out was of type None, not string None(found out by looking up None issue on StackOverflow)
        StackOverflow Link: `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21095654/what-is-a-nonetype-object/34570099`
    8. I proceeded to do an if statement in python to check if its of None type, if so set it to string None
    9. Proceeded with doing string comparison in jinja, where it worked correctly

2. Padding issue between by song preview and top track list
    1. After separating the preview and top track list into their own divs, noticed there was some blank space between the divs
    2. Went straight to google to figure out how to remove the whitespace
    3. Noticed that the solution was related to padding and margin
        StackOverflow Link: `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18315507/remove-margin-between-divs`
    4. Recalled from my IT202 class that you can specify which side of the div you want to modify
    5. So I did the padding and margin modification to the bottom of the song preview div and the top for the track list div

3. Had issues with figuring out how to set up header and parameter for Genius API
    1. Was trying to get the Genius API working, but hit wasn't working correctly
    2. Realized that if I had just scrolled down on the documentation, the answer was right there
    3. Scrolled down to `Authentication` category
    4. Read the documentation and modified my code to work
